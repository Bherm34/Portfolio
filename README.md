When I interpret user needs I look into what the user wants the end product to be and think about how I can fulfill the needs that they are providing making sure I go over these user needs with the team I'm working with. User stories are very helpful with user needs with user stories we create a table on what we need to get done and how the product should come out this makes everything with the project a lot easier. When approaching developing programs we need to go over the user stories so we know what the user wants the product to be then as a team we go over how we get to this product to what the user wants it to be. The agile processes that I want to use in the future is the teamwork I think teamwork is very important in programming, the next thing I want to implement is the meetings these meeting keeps the team informed on what everyone has completed and what we need to finish as a team. To be a good team memeber in development you have to be focused and ready to communicate among the whole team making sure to let the team know what you're completing on that day. When working as a team it's important to keep communication especially with the testers making sure that the product is perfect when it's released for the user making sure to check the user stories along with the product.
